I use this space as a **public notebook**.

I write about:
- research and questions I’m working on
- curious side-quests
- things I’m trying to understand better

Some notes are polished.  
Some are unfinished on purpose.

---

## Research
Notes related to my primary research interests.

- Coming soon

---

## Side quests
Small explorations driven by curiosity.

- Coming soon

---

## Learning journal
Short entries as I learn, unlearn, and connect ideas.

---

### Learning before naming
Most systems teach names first and behavior later.  
Children seem to learn behavior first and names later.  
What breaks if we reverse this order?

---

### Writing as compression
If I can’t write it in a few sentences,  
I probably don’t understand it yet.
